## Overview
This project involves working with another teams' implementation of Project 1 and adding ai along with a new feature to the program.

### `ai.py` - AI Difficulties
This is responsible for the ai class to make shots at the player's ships
1. **Easy** Fires randomly.
2. **Medium** Fires randomly until it hits a ship, then fires orthogonally until it sinks a ship.
3. **Hard** Always hits a ship.

### `Bonus Feature` - Sound
Added extra sounds when placing ships, hitting a ship, and missing a shot.
